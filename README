QUnit-CLI

Example extensions for running QUnit tests from the command line

Examples and extensions assume use of a standalone JavaScript interpeter such as Mozilla Rhino.  QUnit.js is now downloaded as a submodule.  Until my latest changes are accepted, QUnit.js comes from my fork.

To download and run the sample test suite ...

1) git clone git://github.com/benjaminplee/QUnit-CLI.git qunit-cli --recursive
2) setup rhino as described here: http://twoguysarguing.wordpress.com/2010/11/02/make-javascript-tests-part-of-your-build-qunit-rhino/
3) run "js suite.js"
4) Profit!
